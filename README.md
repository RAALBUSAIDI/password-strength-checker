# password-strength-checker
A Python GUI tool to check password strength, entropy, and data breaches using Have I Been Pwned API.
# ðŸ”’ Password Strength Checker

A Python GUI tool built with **Tkinter** that evaluates password strength using:
- Local rule-based analysis (uppercase, lowercase, digits, symbols)
- **Shannon Entropy** for randomness estimation
- **Have I Been Pwned API** check for known data breaches
- Generates strong passwords
- Saves results securely in CSV (passwords stored as SHA1 hashes)
